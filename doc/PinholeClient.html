<H1>PinholeClient - Command line client for Pinhole Server</H1>

<p>
Applications can communicate from the command line to Pinhole using PinholeClient.
<br>
PinholeClient is installed into the same base directory as Pinhole Console and 
should be launched from a console window (cmd on Windows or bash from Linux or Mac).
</p>
<p>
<i>
NOTE: On Linux it is necessary to set the <b>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b> environment variable
to point to the directory containing the PinholeClient binary:
<pre>
:/opt/Pinhole$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/Pinhole ./PinholeClient -v
... or ...
:/opt/Pinhole$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/Pinhole
:/opt/Pinhole$ ./PinholeClient -v
:/opt/Pinhole$ ./PinholeClient -h
...
</pre>
</i>

<p>
PinholeClient provides a basic interface to execute commands, set or retrieve
property values or enter log messages to a single Pinhole Server.  
<br>
One operation is executed per execution.  
<br>
PinholeClient will exit with error level 0 if commands were successful or 1 
if an error occured.
</p>
<p>
The address argument position is where the IPv4, IPv6 or host name of the Pinhole
Server to communicate with is specified.  
<br>
If the server is configured with a password then the -p option must be used to specify the password.
</p>
<p>
Running PinholeClient with -c will list the 'name' values that can be used with the verb 'command'.  
<br>
Beside each command name is the type expected for the command in the value argument position.  
<br>
'void' types do not require an argument and the value argument position can be omitted.
<br>
'QString' types require a string, if the string contains spaces or special characters it 
must be enclosed in quotes.
<br>
'QStringList' types can accept a single string or multiple strings separated by semicolons.
<br>
Again, use quotes if there are spaces or other special characters in any of the strings.
</p>
<p>
Running PinholeClient with -l will list the 'name' properties that can be set or retrieved.
<br>
Beside each property name is the type of the value that must be included in the value
argument position if setting this property.
<br>
'void' types are read-only and can be retrieved but not set.
<br>
'bool' types must be either 'true' or 'false'.
<br>
'int' types must be a numeric value.  Many numeric types have limited ranges and will fail
to set if a value outside their valid range is supplied.
<br>
'QString' and 'QStringList' types are handled the same as for commands.  
<br>
Some QString properties only accept specific strings and will fail if others are supplied.
</p>
<br>
Most non-global properties apply to specific items, and the -i option must be used 
to specify the specific application, group, scheduled event or alert slot for which 
the property is to be set or retrieve.
<br>
'appList', 'groupList', 'schedList', and 'alertSlotList' contail the list of the item
names for each item type.
<br>
The list property values are read only but there are corresponding commands to add and delete
entries from these lists.
<br>
New list entries receive reasonable or empty default values for all properties.
