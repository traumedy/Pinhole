<H1>Importing Settings JSON</H1>

<p>
The JSON settings files exported by Pinhole can  be manually edited before re-importing.
<br>
Sections or value fields that are are removed will leave those settings unchanged when importing.
</p>

<p>
When importing a settings JSON, a dialog will be presented allowing the selection of individual 
sections or items within those sections to be imported.  Only the sections contained within the 
JSON will be listed.
<br>
To omit specific values within a section manually edit the JSON.
<br>
The dialog allows three options for each section that can contain items: 
<ul>
<li>Add or update these entries - The default, this setting will add item entries in the settings 
JSON for this group if none exist with the same name or if one exists with the same name the settings
in the settings JSON will override the settings on the host for that item.  Existing items on the 
host with names that are not in the settings JSON will be left intact.</li>
<li>Set just these entries - Items will on the host will be added or updated as above except that
items on the host that are _not_ in the settings JSON will be removed.</li>
<li>Delete these entries - Items on the host with names matching the names in the settings JSON 
will be removed.  Only the name field be present in the JSON.</li>
</ul>
