<H1>Environment variables</H1>

<p>
New Environment variables can be passed to applications or existing ones 
overriden by putting them in the <b>Environment</b> list.  
<br>
When <b>Add variable</b> is clicked a dummy entry is added to the list 
(<i>NAME=VALUE</i>) and then changed by double clicking on the list entry.
</p>

<p>
Pinhole automatically creates several environment variables for each 
launched application:
<ul>
<li>PINHOLEAPPNAME - The application name</li>
<li>PINHOLEROLE - The global role</li>
<li>PINHOLELOGPIPE - The name of a named pipe that the application can
write to to add entries to the Pinhole log.
<li>PINHOLEAPPPORT - If TCP loopback is enabled for this applicaiton, the 
port number of the TCP loopback port.  <br><b>Note</b> that if the port 
number is changed while the application is running this environment variable 
will not change until the next time the application is launched.
<li>PINHOLEHTTPPORT - If the HTTP server is enabled, the port number of the
Pinhole HTTP server.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
On Unix/Linux OSs Pinhole also sets variables <i>DISPLAY</i> and 
<i>DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS</i> appropriately to tell GUI applications to 
run on the interactive desktop.  These values can be overriden by specifying 
new values in the environment list for an application.
</p>


<p>
Environment variables can reference other existing environment variables
by including %VARIABLENAME% in their VALUE.
<br>
This will be replaced with the value of that variable.  If the variable 
does not exist it will be replaced with an empty string.  
<br>
To include a percent sign in the value use double percents (%%).
<br>
For instance, the PATH environment variable could be expanded by setting:
<pre>
PATH=%PATH%;%ProgramFiles%\additional\path
or
PATH=%PATH%:%HOME%/additional/path
</pre>
Variable names may or may not be case sensitive depending on OS.
