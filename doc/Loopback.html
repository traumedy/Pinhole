<H1>Details about the application TCP loopback</H1>

<p>
Applications can communicate to Pinhole via a TCP loopback.
<br>
<br>
The format for the mesages sent to this port is defined as a single character 
<b>h</b> for a hearbeat message or <b>e</b> for an error followed by an error message 
(sent in a single packet).
<br>
Each application must have a unique TCP port configured to use.  The
value of the port number is set by Pinhole in an environment variable 
named <b>PINHOLEAPPPORT</b> when the application starts.
<br>
The port number can be changed while the application is running without
restarting the application but the environment variable will not be 
changed until the next time the application is launched.
