<H1>Logging</H1>

<p>
Pinhole keeps a log of many internal events that can be 
retrieved later for diagnosing issues.  
<br>
These events can also be monitored in realtime using the Log Monitor dialog.

</p>
The Log Monitor dialog also has a field that allows you to
add entries to the log so you can make a note of an event
that will be useful when reviewing the log later.
</p>

<p>
The system tray icon menu also has an item that will show a 
dialog that allows adding a message to the log.  
<br>
This can be used by clients of permanent installations to make 
note of events.
<br>
The global hotkey Ctrl-Shift-F2 will bring up the logging dialog.
</p>

<p>
Applications can also write messages to the Pinhole log using
a named pipe created for the application.  
<br>
The name of the 
named pipe is stored in an environment variable named 
<b>PINHOLELOGPIPE</b>.  
<br>
This named pipe can be written to like a text file and the output 
will be logged by Pinhole along with the application name.  
<br>
The log text can be prefixed with DEBUG, EXTRA, WARNING or ERROR to
log text at a specific level, otherwise the text is logged at normal.
<br>
Additionally, if the text written to the pipe is prefixed with <b>ALERT</b> 
an alert will be generated with the log text following <b>ALERT</b>.
<br>
Applications can send timeout heartbeats by sending a log message
that with the text <b>HEARTBEAT</b>.  This will not generate a log message.
<br>
Applications can trigger scheduled events (even if the event frequency
is set to <i>disabled</i>) by sending a log message beginning with
<b>TRIGGER</b> followed by one or more event names serparated with 
semicolons.  This means that applications can start and stop other 
applications, take screenshots, reboot the computer, etc.

<br>
From a Windows script you could access the log as such:
<pre>
echo %DATE% %TIME% Application %PINHOLEAPPNAME% starting... > %PINHOLELOGPIPE%
</pre>
Of course, Pinhole time stamps every log entry anyway, this is just an example.

<br>
From python it can be accessed as a file such as:
<pre>
logPipe = open(os.getenviron("PINHOLELOGPIPE"))
logPipe.write("This is a log entry")
logPipe.flush()
</pre>
In TouchDesigner you can use <b>var("PINHOLELOGPIPE")</b> as well.
<br>
After opening the logging pipe you can keep the pipe open and keep 
writing to it, but you must call flush() after each write() call to 
push the buffer to Pinhole for immediate logging.
