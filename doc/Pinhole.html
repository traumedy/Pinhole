<h1>Pinhole</h1>
<h2>Cross Platform Application Management</h2>
<p>
Pinhole is a suite of applications for launching and monitoring applications and 
basic system management of one or more computers. 
<br>
Pinhole allows for configuing the launch of individual applications and scheduling 
various events.
</p>

<h3>Using the interface</h3>

<p>
Every control in the Pinhole UI has both quick tooltip help when you hover over 
it as well as detailed "what's this" help. 
<br>
To access the "what's this" help first put the cursor into "what's this" by clicking 
the "what's this" icon either in the toolbar or in the upper right of a dialog box, 
then click on the control you want information for.&nbsp;

<p>
The main dialog is split into two panels with a host list on the top and a host 
configuration editor on the bottom.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
The configuration editor controls will become enabled when a single host is 
selected in the host list and a connection is established with that host.
</p>

<h3>Using the interface</h3>

<p>
Pinhole Server initially installs with <b>NO PASSWORD</b> which will allow
with Pinhole Client access to the computer running it!
<br>
After a password is set using the <b>Set password</b> button, a prompt dialog
will come up asking for the password the first time Pinhole Console connects to
a password protected host.  
<br>
The passwords are <i>not</i> remembered between executions, you will be required
to reenter the passwords the next time Pinhole Console is run.
<br>
The password can be cleared for a host be entering a blank password when asked
for the password after clicking the <b>Set password</b> button.
<br>
After this anyone will be able to access the unprotected hosts.
