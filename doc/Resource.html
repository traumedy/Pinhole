<H1>Pinhole System Resource Monitoring</H1>

<p>
Pinhole has the ability to monitor available memory and disk space 
and generate alerts when the specified minimum space is no longer available.
<br>
Pinhole will generate one alert when each monitored resource becomes low in 
available space (memory or each disk) and will not generate more alerts again 
until that resource drops to %90 of the specified amount.
<br>
Multiple disks may be monitored, the root of each disk must be listed.
<br>
On Windows this is the drive letter followed by a backslash (such as 
<b>C:\</b>) and on Linux this is the path to where the drive is mounted.
<br>
The alert text will include the name of the resource, the current amount 
of free space and the threshold value.
