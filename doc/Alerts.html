<H1>Pinhole System Alerts</H1>

<p>
Pinhole will generate alerts in some internal critical conditions 
such as if applicaitons reaching their crash throttle limit, and 
applications themselves can generate alerts through the 
<a href="Logging.html">logging pipe</a>.  
<br>
In the global settings Pinhole can also be configured to 
<a href="Resource.html">monitor system resources</a> such as
memory and disk space and will generate an alert of these resources
drop below the specified amount.
<br>
By default alerts are only logged as warnings in the Pinhole log, 
but multiple <i>Alert Slots</i> can be defined to have the alert 
text delivered to additional external targets.
<br>
If sending an external alert fails for any reason an error is logged
in the Pinhole log.  If successful a normal log entry is made.
<br>
These are the types of Alert Slots:  
<ul>
<li>SMTP Email</li>
<li>HTTP GET</li>
<li>HTTP POST</li>
<li>Slack Webhook</li>
</ul>
</p>

<H2>SMTP Email</H2>
<p>
Emails can be sent using SSL encrypted servers.  
<br>
You must fill in the SMTP fields to provide information about 
the server and authentication to send the email.  
<br>
The argument field in the table should contain the email address
to send the email to.
<br>
For some email services such as Yahoo Mail or Gmail you must lower
the security permissions to allow 'older apps' to access/use the
mail service.
<br>
If SSL is checked the connection will be initially encrypted.  This
is usually used on port 465.
<br>
If TLS is checked the connection will NOT be initially encrypted
but if the server supports the STARTTLS method encryption will be
started after the initial connection has been established.  This is
usually used on port 587.
<br>
Authentication methods CRAM-MD5, LOGIN and PLAIN are supported.
<br>
</p>

<H2>HTTP GET</H2>
<p>
This type performs a simple HTTP GET request to the URL provided
in the argument field.
<br>
The provided URL can (should) include the string <b>$ALERT$</b> 
which will be replaced with the percent encoded text of the alert.
<br>
The response to the GET request is discarded.
<br>
</p>

<H2>HTTP POST</H2>
<p>
This type performs a simple HTTP POST to the URL provided in the
argument field.
<br>
The text of the alert is sent to the server with the content type
<b>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</b>.
<br>
The response to the POST request is discarded.
</p>

<H2>Slack</H2>
<p>
This type performs a simple HTTP POST to the URL provided in the
argument field.
<br>
The text of the alert is sent to the server encoded as a single 
json field <b>text</b> with the content type <b>application/json</b>.
<br>
The response to the POST request is discarded.
<br>
This type can be used for any other compatible Webhook.
</p>

<H2>External command</H2>
<p>
This type executes an external program with the command line specified
in the argument.<br>
The command line can (should) contain the string <b>$ALERT$<b>
which will be replaced with the text of the alert.  Arguments are split
with whitespace or grouped with quotes.  To pass a quote used tripple 
quotes.
<br>
As an example on Windows, this command line would launch cmd.exe 
and write alerts to a file c:\log\alerts.txt with a time and date stamp:
<pre>
cmd /C echo %DATE% %TIME% $ALERT$ >> c:\log\alerts.txt
</pre>
