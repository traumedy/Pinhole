<H1>Using a Pinhole Backend</H1>

<p>
In addition to communicating with PinholeServer directly  
via a local TCP connection, a backend proxy server can be 
deployed in a location accessible from servers and clients 
when clients may not be able to connect directly to servers. 
<br>
PinholeBackend is a console application that listens for 
connections from PinholeServer, then acts much as a Pinhole 
Server itself.  When scanned using the <b>Find additional 
hosts</b> dialog, any instances of PinholeServer connected 
to the backend will appear in the host list and can then be 
connect to as if they were on they were local.  Their status 
will also continue to be updated.  
<br>
To configure PinholeServer to connect to PinholeBackend 
put the host name or IP address of the machine running 
PinholeBackend in the <b>Pinhole backend server</b> field 
on the <b>Global</b> tab in the settings for a host.
