<H1>Custom actions</H1>

<p>
<br>
Custom actions are buttons that perform specific tasks on specific items
that would normally be performed from the lower panel on one host at a 
time, such as startting or stopping a specific application.
<br>
By creating a custom action button commonly needed actions can be accomplished
on one or more machines simultaneously without needing to first select 
the appropriate group tab and item needed.  Some actions can also be performed 
on multiple items at once.
<br>
Custom action buttons can be added to the standard action buttons on the
left side of the top panel using the <b>Add custom action</b> button:
<img src="images/customaction.png"/>
<br>
After a custom action button has been created it can be renamed or removed
by right clicking on the button.
